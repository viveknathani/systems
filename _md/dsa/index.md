1. [Design Twitter](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-twitter/)

This is a good problem to understand how effective hash tables can be. Although this is a very basic design of how Twitter could work and real engineering behind Twitter is far more complex, they do [use Redis extensively](http://highscalability.com/blog/2014/9/8/how-twitter-uses-redis-to-scale-105tb-ram-39mm-qps-10000-ins.html) which in turn makes extensive usage of hash tables.
